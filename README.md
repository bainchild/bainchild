Hello.
---
I am knowledgeable (in terms of syntax and common concepts/idioms) on the following languages (in order of a preference):
 - Lua(u) (>=100%)
 - Rust (>70%)
 - Javascript (>80%)
 - C (>70%)
 - Shell
 - Java
 - C#
 - C++

##### HTML and CSS are not in this list because I don't consider them notable enough; I'm about 30% knowledgeable on HTML, 50% for CSS. I prefer Javascript, or Rust, generated sites over them.
