Hello.
---

I have had approximately 5.5 years experience (as of 2025), with half of it being offline or unshared modification of running code, a third being private projects, and the remaining share being public (or available to be made public, if asked).  
  
I mainly work in backend programming, but I have spent time on:
 - all forms of scripting,
 - command line development,
 - embedded development,
 - frontend development,
 - hardware assembly design,
 - desktop/mobile development

with desktop/mobile development having the least time spent on it.  

I've also worked on a good number of esoteric projects, which are the primary sort visible on my github page.

[^1]: HTML and CSS are not in these lists because I don't consider them notable enough or hard enough to master; I'm about 30% knowledgeable on HTML, 50% for CSS. I prefer Javascript, or Rust, generated sites over them.
